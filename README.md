# career_path
__One opinionate career path for product people (product, design, tech...)__

## Pitch
This tool is about continuous learning and improvement in products' main domains: Product, Design, Tech,...; and subdomains: Product Strategy, Product Marketing, User Research, User Interface, User Experience, Data, Software Design, Crafts(wo)manship and more...

## Goal
Meanwhile, it's an opportunity to give ReScript a try on an actual project. __The goal is primarily for my own daily use.__
However, I will build it as an open-sourced and public product. So, anybody can use it or fork it for its own use.

## Tech Notes
